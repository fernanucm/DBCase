# DBCase
DBCASE is a tool for graphical design of relational databases. Its purpose is making the process
of designing databases easier, using the entity-relationship diagram, checking its correctness and
creating the SQL code associated to the tables.

This tool is targeted to academic purposes, but it can also be useful in other environments. It has
a multi-platform implementation, so it can used in Windows systems, GNU/Linux distributions
(already tested in Debian and Ubuntu), and MAC OS X.
The graphical user interface has been designed following the standards of entity-relationship
diagrams described in the most commonly used database design literature. This makes the used
notation more user-friendly.

Besides making possible to design and test a scheme, the application performs the task of
generating and executing a SQL script adapted to three different data base management systems:
MySQL, Oracle, and ACCESS. This process is automatic and simplifies both time and
complexity of a theoretical design implemented in practice.

The main purpose of the tool is to help students of database theory in the design of databases,
and also to help both teachers and professionals to simplify the database design process in its
three main stages and automatically obtaining the physical schema as SQL code.
